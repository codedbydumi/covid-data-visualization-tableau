# Methodology

## Research Approach

### 1. Problem Statement
This study aims to analyze global COVID-19 transmission patterns, identify seasonal trends, and provide actionable insights for public health decision-making through interactive data visualization.

### 2. Research Questions
- What are the temporal patterns of COVID-19 transmission globally?
- How do different countries compare in their pandemic response effectiveness?
- What seasonal or cyclical patterns exist in case numbers?
- Which variables are most predictive of transmission rates?
- How do outlier events (policy changes, variants) impact case trends?

### 3. Data Collection Strategy
**Primary Data Source**: Our World in Data COVID-19 Database
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive, standardized, regularly updated
- **Coverage**: Global scope with country-level granularity
- **Time Period**: January 2020 - December 2023
- **Update Frequency**: Daily

**Data Selection Criteria**:
- Countries with consistent reporting (>90% data completeness)
- Minimum population threshold (>1M people)
- Available time series data for key metrics

### 4. Analytical Framework

#### Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Schema validation
   - Initial data profiling
   - Quality assessment

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Missing value treatment (forward/backward fill)
   - Duplicate removal
   - Outlier identification and handling
   - Data type standardization

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Time-based variables (month, quarter, day_of_year)
   - Rolling averages (7-day, 14-day)
   - Growth rates and derivatives
   - Categorical groupings

#### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
1. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Central tendency measures
   - Distribution analysis
   - Variability assessment

2. **Temporal Analysis**
   - Time series decomposition
   - Trend identification
   - Seasonality detection
   - Wave pattern recognition

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Cross-country benchmarking
   - Regional pattern identification
   - Performance clustering

#### Phase 3: Statistical Analysis
1. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Pearson correlation coefficients
   - Lag correlation analysis
   - Partial correlation (controlling for confounders)

2. **Outlier Detection**
   - Interquartile Range (IQR) method
   - Z-score analysis
   - Modified Z-score (robust method)
   - Contextual outlier interpretation

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Peak detection algorithms
   - Seasonal decomposition
   - Growth phase classification

#### Phase 4: Visualization & Dashboard Design
1. **Chart Selection Principles**
   - Time series: Line charts for trends
   - Geographic: Choropleth maps for spatial patterns
   - Comparative: Bar charts for rankings
   - Correlational: Scatter plots and heatmaps

2. **Interactive Design**
   - Filter implementation
   - Drill-down capabilities
   - Cross-chart filtering
   - User-driven exploration

### 5. Statistical Methods

#### Outlier Detection Methods
```python
# IQR Method
Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
outliers = data[(data < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (data > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]

# Z-Score Method
z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(data))
outliers = data[z_scores > 3]

# Modified Z-Score (Robust)
median = np.median(data)
mad = stats.median_abs_deviation(data)
modified_z = 0.6745 * (data - median) / mad
outliers = data[np.abs(modified_z) > 3.5]
```

#### Correlation Analysis
- **Pearson Correlation**: Linear relationships
- **Lag Correlation**: Time-delayed relationships
- **Partial Correlation**: Controlling for confounding variables

#### Wave Detection Algorithm
```python
from scipy.signal import find_peaks
peaks, properties = find_peaks(data, 
                               height=threshold,
                               distance=min_days_between_peaks,
                               prominence=min_prominence)
```

### 6. Validation Approaches
- **Cross-validation**: Time series split validation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter robustness testing
- **External Validation**: Comparison with published epidemiological studies
- **Peer Review**: Academic and professional feedback incorporation

### 7. Limitations & Assumptions
**Assumptions**:
- Consistent reporting standards across countries
- Random missingness pattern in data gaps
- Case numbers reflect underlying transmission (acknowledging testing limitations)

**Limitations**:
- Reporting bias and testing capacity variations
- Policy change impacts on data quality
- Underreporting in certain regions/time periods
- Lag between infection and reporting

### 8. Ethical Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: No individual-level data used
- **Public Good**: Analysis aimed at public health benefit
- **Transparency**: Open methodology and reproducible code
- **Responsible Reporting**: Balanced interpretation of findings
