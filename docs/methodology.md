# Methodology

## Research Approach

### 1. Problem Statement
This study aims to analyze global COVID-19 transmission patterns, identify seasonal trends, and provide actionable insights for public health decision-making through interactive data visualization.

### 2. Research Questions
- What are the temporal patterns of COVID-19 transmission globally?
- How do different countries compare in their pandemic response effectiveness?
- What seasonal or cyclical patterns exist in case numbers?
- Which variables are most predictive of transmission rates?
- How do outlier events (policy changes, variants) impact case trends?

### 3. Data Collection Strategy
**Primary Data Source**: Our World in Data COVID-19 Database
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive, standardized, regularly updated

- **Time Period**: January 2020 - December 2023
- **Update Frequency**: Daily

**Data Selection Criteria**:
- Countries with consistent reporting (>90% data completeness)
- Minimum population threshold (>1M people)
- Available time series data for key metrics

### 5. Statistical Methods

#### Outlier Detection Methods
```python
# IQR Method
Q1 = data.quantile(0.25)
Q3 = data.quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
outliers = data[(data < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (data > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]

# Z-Score Method
z_scores = np.abs(stats.zscore(data))
outliers = data[z_scores > 3]

# Modified Z-Score (Robust)
median = np.median(data)
mad = stats.median_abs_deviation(data)
modified_z = 0.6745 * (data - median) / mad
outliers = data[np.abs(modified_z) > 3.5]
```

#### Correlation Analysis
- **Pearson Correlation**: Linear relationships
- **Lag Correlation**: Time-delayed relationships
- **Partial Correlation**: Controlling for confounding variables

#### Wave Detection Algorithm
```python
from scipy.signal import find_peaks
peaks, properties = find_peaks(data, 
                               height=threshold,
                               distance=min_days_between_peaks,
                               prominence=min_prominence)
```

### 6. Validation Approaches
- **Cross-validation**: Time series split validation
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Parameter robustness testing
- **External Validation**: Comparison with published epidemiological studies
- **Peer Review**: Academic and professional feedback incorporation

### 7. Limitations & Assumptions
**Assumptions**:
- Consistent reporting standards across countries
- Random missingness pattern in data gaps
- Case numbers reflect underlying transmission (acknowledging testing limitations)

**Limitations**:
- Reporting bias and testing capacity variations
- Policy change impacts on data quality
- Underreporting in certain regions/time periods
- Lag between infection and reporting

### 8. Ethical Considerations
- **Data Privacy**: No individual-level data used
- **Public Good**: Analysis aimed at public health benefit
- **Transparency**: Open methodology and reproducible code
- **Responsible Reporting**: Balanced interpretation of findings

### Data Processing Notes

#### Missing Value Treatment
1. **Essential Variables**: Rows dropped if missing (location, date)
2. **Numerical Variables**: Forward fill then backward fill by location
3. **Derived Variables**: Calculated after missing value treatment

#### Outlier Handling
1. **Statistical Outliers**: Identified but retained with flagging
2. **Contextual Analysis**: Verified against known events
3. **Robust Statistics**: Used median/IQR for central tendency

#### Data Validation Rules
- `new_cases >= 0` (non-negative constraint)
- `total_cases >= previous_day_total_cases` (monotonic constraint)
- `date` within expected range (2020-01-01 to present)
- `location` matches ISO country codes

## Usage Guidelines

### Recommended Applications
- ✅ Time series analysis and forecasting
- ✅ Cross-country comparative studies
- ✅ Seasonal pattern identification
- ✅ Dashboard and visualization development

### Limitations & Cautions
- ⚠️ Testing capacity varies significantly between countries
- ⚠️ Reporting standards may differ across regions
- ⚠️ Case numbers represent detected cases, not total infections
- ⚠️ Death counts may have varying lag times and definitions
